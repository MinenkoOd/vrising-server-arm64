## Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your ARM64 Linux machine
- Exposed UDP ports 9876 and 9877 on your ARM64 Linux machine

## Getting Started

- Create a container from the built image and map the necessary ports:

```bash
docker run -d --name vrising -p 9876:9876/udp -p 9877:9877/udp -v /path/to/save-data:/vrising/data -v /path/to/server:/vrising/server gogoout/vrising-arm64
```

- Docker compose

```yaml
version: '1.0'
services:
  vrising:
    stdin_open: true # equivalent of -i
    tty: true        # equivalent of -t
    # build: . # Build from Dockerfile
    restart: unless-stopped
    container_name: vrising
    labels:
      vrising-app: true
    image: vrising
    network_mode: bridge
    environment:
      - TZ=Asia/Tokyo
    volumes:
      - '/home/ubuntu/v/server:/vrising/server:rw'
      - '/home/ubuntu/v/data:/vrising/data:rw'
    ports:
      - '9876:9876/udp'
      - '9877:9877/udp'
      - '25575:25575/tcp'
  autoheal:
    restart: always
    image: willfarrell/autoheal
    environment:
      - AUTOHEAL_CONTAINER_LABEL=vrising-app
      - AUTOHEAL_INTERVAL=15
      - AUTOHEAL_ONLY_MONITOR_RUNNING=true
      - AUTOHEAL_START_PERIOD=600
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
```

Replace `/path/to/save-data` with the path where you want to store the server's save data on your host machine.
Replace `/path/to/server` with the path where you want to store the server's save data on your host machine.

## Configuration

Upon first run, the server will generate default configuration files at `/vrising/data/Settings/` if not provided. You
can modify this file to customize your server settings
following [official guide](https://github.com/StunlockStudios/vrising-dedicated-server-instructions).

## Volumes

The Docker image accepts the following volumes:

| Volume Path            | Description                                  |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `/vrising/server`      | Location where the game server persists      |
| `/vrising/data`        | Location for save data, server configs, etc. |
| `/home/steam/steamcmd` | Location where SteamCMD is saved             |

## Known Issues

- The server would random crash after sometimes. I have included a health check script to test the server if it is not
  running. It's recommended to use docker-compose to run the server. The autoheal container will restart the server if
  it's not running.
- The health check script checks if any files is being modified in the last 3 minutes. So be sure to set your
  AutoSaveInterval to less than 3 minutes.
